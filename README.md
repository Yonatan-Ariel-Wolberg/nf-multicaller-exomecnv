# nf-multicaller-exomecnv

A Nextflow pipeline for comprehensive genomic analysis combining multiple variant callers with exome and copy number variation (CNV) detection. Based on a workflow by Dr Phelelani T Mpangase: https://github.com/phelelani/nf-exomecnv.

## Overview

This pipeline implements a robust bioinformatics workflow for analyzing genomic data using:
- Multiple variant calling approaches
- Exome analysis
- Copy number variation (CNV) detection

Built with Nextflow for reproducible, scalable, and portable data analysis.

## Features

- **Multi-caller approach**: Integrates multiple variant calling algorithms for robust variant detection
- **Exome analysis**: Specialized processing for whole exome sequencing (WES) data
- **CNV detection**: Comprehensive copy number variation analysis
- **Nextflow-based**: Ensures reproducibility and scalability across different computing environments
- **Containerized**: Includes Docker/Singularity support for dependency management

## Requirements

### Software
- **Nextflow**: >= 20.04
- **Java**: >= 8

### Computing Resources
- Adequate CPU cores (parallel execution recommended)
- Sufficient disk space for intermediate and output files
- Memory requirements depend on dataset size

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yonatan-Ariel-Wolberg/nf-multicaller-exomecnv.git
cd nf-multicaller-exomecnv
